1. Which programming languages have you used before now? How comfortable were you using 
them? 
	I have used php, Java, Javascript, a little bit of python and C, and some basic hello world type stuff with ruby. I am most comfortable programming in Java and javascript. I have used Java pretty extensively, in AP CS in high school, and through a year's worth of curriculum at CSU (don't hate me) before transferring to CU (go buffs). I have been using a lot of javascript lately for web projects, so I would say that's my sharpest knife at the moment. The rest of the languages I mentioned are pretty rusty. 

2. Tell me a little bit about the most difficult program you have written. Did you get it to work, or 
to mostly work?
	One of the most difficult and fun programs I've written was a java program which accepted an image, and could perform basic transformations on the image such as rotation, inversion, mirroring, color hues and brightness modifications. The program was also able to accept images of varying sizes, and write the modified images to a file. I was able to get the program to work fully!

3. What’s the main skill you’d like to be able to gain from the class?

	I am very excited to learn about graph databases and learning about how best to develop effecient algorithms over such a data structure. I'm excited about this because 

4. Do you have a laptop that you can use for this class? 
5. Do you prefer to do your work in advance, or at the last minute? (Or do you plan to do it in 
advance, and then end up doing it at the last minute anyway?)
6. When during the week (outside of your recitation) are you free to come get help in the lab? 
When can you not make it?
7. What other concerns do you have? For instance, are you worried that you’ll be racing to keep 
up in here, or that you’ll be bored? 
8. Is there anything I should know about you in order to treat you fairly in the class?
