1. I have used php, Java, Javascript, a little bit of python and C, and some basic hello world type stuff with ruby. I am most comfortable programming in Java and javascript. I have used Java pretty extensively, in AP CS in high school, and through a year's worth of curriculum at CSU (don't hate me) before transferring to CU (go buffs). I have been using a lot of javascript lately for web projects, so I would say that's my sharpest knife at the moment. The rest of the languages I mentioned are pretty rusty.



2. One of the most difficult and fun programs I've written was a java program which accepted an image, and could perform basic transformations on the image such as rotation, inversion, mirroring, color hues and brightness modifications. The program was also able to accept images of varying sizes, and write the modified images to a file. I was able to get the program to work fully!



3. I am very excited to learn about graph databases and learning about how best to develop efficient algorithms over such a data structure. I'm excited to apply this knowledge towards the web app I am currently building for my startup!



4. That I do.



5. I definitely prefer to work in advance, whether that actually happens usually banks on me being on a good sleep/life schedule. The aforementioned startup may also complicate things unexpectedly from time to time.



6. I’m pretty flexible. I’m working full time on the startup and taking 7 credits this semester.



7. My greatest concern is probably balancing my time between class and my company. Other than that I feel like I’m a pretty competent programmer and am looking forward to being challenged :)



8. Understanding as far as my work load outside of school would really be appreciated. I’m very responsible, but sometimes things get really hectic but I will absolutely do my best and work my hardest!
